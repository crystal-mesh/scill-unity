<!-- This resource is required for Unity - when building targets requiring the IL2CPP generator, the generator will otherwise remove types and members that are not directly used, 
e.g. when generating an object of a type using reflection, the constructor of that type might never be used directly and will therefore be stripped from the byte code,
resulting in errors on the IL2CPP based build target. 
The link.xml is embedded as an resource in the SCILL.csproj definiton. This is required for unity to recognize the link.xml file, even if used inside a package. If the lÃ­nk.xml file
were to be placed directly inside a package, Unity would not recognize it at build time.
