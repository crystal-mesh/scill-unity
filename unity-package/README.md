## Getting Started

You can install the SDK using different methods:

### Package Manager: Adding from git URL

Use "add a package from git URL..." with this URL: https://github.com/crystal-mesh/scill-unity.git?path=/unity-package

### Package Manager: Adding from disk

Clone the repository to your local disk and use "add package from disk...". Navigate to "repository-path/unity-package" and select the package.json file.

### Unity Package

You can download the SCILL Unity SDK as a .unitypackage from our Github releases page at https://github.com/scillgame/scill-unity/releases/latest

Because Unity does not resolve dependencies automatically when importing Assets as a `.unitypackage`, you will need to ensure that Unityâ€™s Newtonsoft-JSON package has been added to your project. To add the Newtonsoft package to your project, navigate to the Package Manager by using the `Window` -> `Package Manager` menu. In the Package Manager window, click on the + button, choose `Add package from git URL ...` and enter the package reference: `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`
